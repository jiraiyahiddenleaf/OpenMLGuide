# Mastering the Mathematical Foundations of ML

While mathematics is a valuable part of ML, it's not always necessary to grasp it fully from the outset. Start by learning to code, building projects, and gaining practical experience. High school-level math is often sufficient for many ML tasks. Later, as you grow more comfortable with the field, you can gradually delve into the deeper mathematical concepts.
