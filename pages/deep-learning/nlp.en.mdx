### Papers 

- [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) (2013): Introduced two model architectures for word vector representations derived from large datasets, outperforming existing methods in word similarity tasks with enhanced accuracy and lower computational demands. These vectors excel in measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.

- [GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) (2014): Proposed GloVe, a model that learns word meanings from co-occurrence statistics. It uses a global co-occurrence matrix to derive word vectors, demonstrating superior performance in various word analogy and similarity tasks compared to other methods.

- [Deep contextualized word representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365) (2018): Introduces novel word representations capturing both meaning and context in sentences. These representations stem from a deep bidirectional language model trained on extensive text. They excel in various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, surpassing other techniques in performance.

- [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) (2018): Presents BERT, a pre-trained deep bidirectional transformer model. Trained on extensive text data with a masked language modeling objective, it excels in natural NLP like question answering and sentiment analysis, surpassing alternative methods in performance and versatility.

- [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (2017): Introduced the groundbreaking concept of the Transformer architecture, an attention-based neural architecture for sequence processing. It outperforms other methods in NLP tasks like machine translation and language modeling, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing contextual information from input sequences like sentences.
