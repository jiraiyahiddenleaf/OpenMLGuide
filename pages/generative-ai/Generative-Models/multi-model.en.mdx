### Articles & Papers

- [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/) (2023): LLaVA-1.5 excels in 11 benchmarks with minimal changes from LLaVA, using only public data, quick training in ~1 day on a single 8-A100 node, and outperforming billion-scale data methods. It's a powerful multimodal model, rivaling GPT-4 in chat capabilities and setting a new Science QA accuracy record.

### Models

- [Fuyu-8B](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b), an [ADEPT](https://www.adept.ai/) multimodal model, excels at text and image comprehension. It simplifies the traditional transformer architecture, making it easier to grasp, scale, and deploy. Fuyu-8B handles complex visual relationships, including charts and documents, and performs tasks like OCR and text localization in images.
