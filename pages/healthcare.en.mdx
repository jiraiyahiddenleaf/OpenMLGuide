### LLMs in Healthcare

- [Med-PaLM 2](https://sites.research.google/med-palm/) by Google Research, is an AI model tailored for the medical domain, available for limited testing by select Google Cloud customers. It excels in USMLE-style questions, reaching 'expert' performance on the MedQA dataset, and handling diverse biomedical data types. Healthcare organizations like HCA Healthcare, Mayo Clinic, and Meditech have tested it to augment healthcare workflows.

- [LLMs Encode Clinical Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saWEFDRuNJc): Researchers are leveraging LLMs for medical applications, introducing MultiMedQA to evaluate their capabilities. Flan-PaLM, a 540-B parameter LLM, exhibits impressive accuracy on multiple-choice datasets, hinting at LLM potential in medicine [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138).  

- [ClinicalBERT](https://huggingface.co/medicalai/ClinicalBERT) trained on a vast dataset containing 1.2B words related to various diseases. Fine-tuning utilized EHRs from 3 million patient records. ClinicalBERT, initiated from BERT, employs a masked language model training approach. Text segments with randomly replaced tokens (MASKs) challenge the model to predict the original tokens in a contextual context.

- [LLMs in Healthcare: Benchmarks, Applications, and Compliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXN-kMWq6aY): This session discusses the progress and challenges of LLMs in healthcare. It highlights benchmarks for healthcare-specific LLMs, a robust architecture for medical chatbots, and comprehensive testing for bias, fairness, robustness, and toxicity.
