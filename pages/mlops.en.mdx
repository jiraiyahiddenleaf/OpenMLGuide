### Guides

- [Cloud GPUs](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/cloud-gpus/) by The Full Stack, In neural network training, hardware acceleration—typically GPUs—is crucial. The platform organizes cloud GPU vendor pricing into sortable tables, categorizing offerings into GPU Cloud Servers, which are long-running and possibly pre-emptible, and Serverless GPUs that scale to zero when inactive, similar to AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Function.

- [MLOps Org](https://ml-ops.org/content/references.html) is a comprehensive MLOps resource, covering core principles, recommended books, frameworks, tools, and best practices. It discusses fundamental MLOps principles, references key frameworks and communities, and highlights crucial components for MLOps success. Additionally, it introduces the MLOps Stack Canvas for structured ML application development and maintenance.

### Books

- [Introducing MLOps: How to Scale Machine Learning in the Enterprise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55182023-introducing-mlops) by Mark Treveil & Nicolas Omont provides a comprehensive introduction to MLOps, explaining its key concepts, the problems it solves, and the processes involved in a successful ML life cycle.

- [Practical MLOps: Operationalizing Machine Learning Models](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58218463-practical-mlops) by Alfredo Deza & Noah Gift, offers a hands-on approach to MLOps, focusing on the operationalization of machine learning models. It provides practical examples and techniques for managing the production life cycle of ML models using MLOps.

- [Machine Learning Engineering](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55275944-machine-learning-engineering) by Andriy Burkov's book, while not exclusively centered on MLOps, delves into diverse facets of ML engineering, encompassing model deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. It serves as a comprehensive resource for grasping the engineering elements of ML, making it a valuable complement to your MLOps expertise.
