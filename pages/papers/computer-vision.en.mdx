[Paper with Code computer vision papers section](https://paperswithcode.com/area/computer-vision):  Provides access to research papers along with the corresponding code.

- [AlexNet](https://paperswithcode.com/method/alexnet) (2012): This convolutional neural network architecture was one of the first large CNNs to significantly outperform traditional computer vision methods on the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) dataset. It demonstrated the power of deep learning for computer vision.

- [Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524) (2014): Introduced the R-CNN algorithm for object detection. It uses region proposals and CNN features to detect objects in images. R-CNN significantly improved detection accuracy and kicked off the rapid progress in object detection research.

- [Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) (2015): Introduced improvements to R-CNN with their Faster R-CNN algorithm. By introducing a Region Proposal Network, Faster R-CNN sped up object detection significantly compared to R-CNN.

- [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) (2017): Presented an extension to Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the bounding box. This Mask R-CNN architecture enables detecting and segmenting objects in one model.

- [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) (2019): A convolutional neural network architecture using a scaling method that balances network depth, width, and resolution. EfficientNet achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet with significantly fewer parameters.

- [Densely Connected Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) (2017): Introduced dense connectivity between layers to strengthen feature propagation and reduce vanishing gradients.

- [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) (2016): Framed object detection as a regression problem to apply a single neural network to the full image, enabling extremely fast detection.

- [Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7062) (2014): Introduced atrous convolution to capture multi-scale context for semantic segmentation. Significantly improved segmentation accuracy.

- [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) (2015): Introduced an encoder-decoder network with skip connections for biomedical image segmentation. Became widely used for semantic and instance segmentation.

- [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) (2014): Demonstrated the benefit of convolutional neural network depth using smaller 3x3 filters stacked across 16-19 weight layers.

- [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (2015): Developed deep residual networks using skip connections to enable training 100+ layer networks. Drove rapid progress in image classification.

- [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829) (2017): Proposed capsule networks with dynamic routing to better model hierarchical relationships than standard CNNs.

- [Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) (2017): Presented adversarial training for unpaired image-to-image translation between domains without matched image pairs.
