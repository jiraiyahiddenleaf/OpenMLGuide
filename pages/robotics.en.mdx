 ### Articles

- [Robots in the Manufacturing Industry](https://www.wevolver.com/article/robots-in-the-manufacturing-industry-types-and-applications): Explore the dynamic landscape of automation, robotics, and smart technologies reshaping modern manufacturing. Gain insights into how robots are enhancing efficiency, precision, and innovation across production lines, and discover the evolving role of AI-driven automation in this transformative field.

- [Scaling up learning across many different robot types](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/scaling-up-learning-across-many-different-robot-types) (2023): DeepMind's new resources promote general-purpose robotics learning across diverse robot types. The [Open X-Embodiment](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/) dataset compiles data from 22 robots, while the RT-1-X model transfers skills effectively among them. Tested in five research labs, it demonstrated a 50% improvement compared to specialized methods. [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08864) 

### Papers

- [Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/d5e2c0adad503c91f91df240d0cd4e49-Paper.pdf) (2017): Exploration of reinforcement learning in gaming and robotics domains revealed its remarkable utility for Language Models.

- [Habitat 3.0: A Co-Habitat for Humans, Avatars and Robots](https://aihabitat.org/habitat3/): AI Habitat, a 3D simulator, trains embodied AI agents, like virtual robots, in a photorealistic and efficient environment. Habitat 3.0 specializes in tasks such as house cleaning. In contrast, Habitat III refers to the 2016 UN Conference in Quito, Ecuador, aiming to promote sustainable urbanization and implement a New Urban Agenda.
